## Wat?

A small Windows program that demonstrates the 
[A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), 
used to do simple grid-based pathfinding. You select among open space,
an impassible wall, slow-to-traverse water, and click squares to
place terrain. Then set a start point, end goal, and click Next to see
it go step-by-step, or Finish to see it run through to completion.

## Why?

I did it for a class side project early in undergrad. 
Recently a friend expressed interest in seeing it, 
so I'm making it public!

## How?

This was made in Microsoft Visual Studio (most likely 2010 Express), but
it seems to work fine in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition. It uses
Windows Presentation Foundation to do the GUI stuff.
